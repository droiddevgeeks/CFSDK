# CF SDK Update

<!-- Plugin description -->
This is the CF SDKs update checker plugin. 
It operates silently in the background, continuously monitoring and retrieving the latest information about available SDK updates. 
When a new SDK update is detected, the plugin promptly notifies the user through a notification. This notification provides a convenient and immediate way to stay informed about updates. By clicking on the notification, the user is directed to the detailed change log page, which outlines the specific changes and improvements included in the new SDK version. 
This ensures that users are always up-to-date with the latest enhancements and features offered by 
CF.
